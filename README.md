# Tic-Tac-Toe
A simple program which pretends to play tic-tac-toe with the user.


## Scenario

The program checks if the game is over − there are four possible verdicts: the game should continue, the game ends with a tie, you win, or the computer wins;
the computer responds with its move and the check is repeated;
don't implement any form of artificial intelligence − a random field choice made by the computer is good enough for the game.

The example session with the program may look as follows:

1	|	2	|	3
---|	---|	---
4	|	X	|	6
7 | 	8	|	9

Enter your move: 1

O	|	2	|	3
---|	---|	---
4	|	X	|	6
7 | 	8	|	9

O	|	X	|	3
---|	---|	---
4	|	X	|	6
7 | 	8	|	9

Enter your move: 8

Some moves later...

O	|	X	|	X
---|	---|	---
0	|	X	|	X
0 | 	8	|	9

You won!
