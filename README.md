# Tic-Tac-Toe
A simple program which pretends to play tic-tac-toe with the user.


## Scenario

The program checks if the game is over − there are four possible verdicts: the game should continue, the game ends with a tie, you win, or the computer wins;
the computer responds with its move and the check is repeated;
don't implement any form of artificial intelligence − a random field choice made by the computer is good enough for the game.

The example session with the program may look as follows:
